# Multiple-Linear-Regression

We will explore be solving a simple business task using Multiple Linear Regression.

**Task: Venture capital fund analysis** We have been given a dataset that contains a list of 50 companies with their yearly expenditure on R&D (Research & Development), Administration, Marketing and State (New York, California, Florida), alongside their Profit. Our task is to explore which companies we should invest in in order to optimise our profits.

We will be using Multiple Linear Regression to carry out this task.

**Assumptions of a linear regression:**
- Linearity
- Homoscedasticity
- Multivariate Normality
- Independence of errors
- Lack of multicollinearity

**Backwards Elimination:**
